# Out_of_Time

Beneath the clock
She counts her days
But in the past
It waits

It watches silently
And shuns the crowd
But through its glass
It hates

A celebration
From yesteryear
With cake to mark
One's growth

A working chap
With collar blue
Eyeing warily 
The host

Cast aside 
Its false persona
Confront it 
As a hero

No escape
No surrender
You must ask it
"ARE YOU ZERO?"
